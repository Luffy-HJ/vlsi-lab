### Makefile Analysis

This repository includes a detailed analysis of the Makefile used in the OpenROAD flow. The Makefile includes two external files, `config.mk` and `variables.mk`, which define various configurations and variables essential for the build process. The complete analysis, along with comments and explanations, can be found in the `flow-analysis.md` file.
